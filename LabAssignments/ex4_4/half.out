Runtime of memory copying from host to device = 32 ms
average time of kernel simple_fpu = 1168.25 ms
Total runtime of the CNN layer = 1678 ms

Runtime of matrix transpose = 352 ms
Tiling size = 32
average time of kernel optimized_fpu = 111.442 ms

Memory copying and matrix transpose time reduce, but average time of optimized_fpu increase.
Guess there's operation overloading and cause time increase!?
Total time almost the same but loss 8 bits precision
